# Accessible Zen

Accessible Zen is an accessible, minimalistic, readable, and fully responsive WordPress theme by [David A. Kennedy](http://davidakennedy.com). Inspired by Leo Babauta's [Zen Habits theme](http://zenhabits.net/theme/), Accessible Zen puts the focus on your content and nothing else, plus it has plenty of WordPress goodness built right in.

**Current Release on Github**: 0.1-alpha

**Current Release on WordPress.org Theme Directory**: N/A (Not submitted yet)

## Alpha Release

**Just so you know...** This is an Alpha release. That means it's early in the game. I'm still developing the theme and I really don’t recommend that you run it on a production site — set up a test site just to play with it.

*I may change the theme significantly before its official release*.

I'd love to hear what you think! You can submit feedback on the [Github issues section](https://github.com/davidakennedy/Accessible-Zen/issues), or by emailing me at me (at) davidakennedy dot com.

## Features

- Uses HTML5 with dashes of CSS3 for a future-friendly site.
- Meets both [Section 508 standards](http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?&FuseAction=Content&ID=12) and [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, Level AA](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/). This includes a [carefully-choosen color scheme](http://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/color-contrast/accessible-color-palette.php?colors=ffffff,f5f5f5,d5d5d5,e5e5e5,333333,666666,f6fcff,e5f7ff,00354C,00628C,008FCC,007DB2&level=AA).
- Code based on Automattic's [Underscores WordPress theme](http://underscores.me/) to help ensure use of WordPress theme standards.
- Supports all modern browsers, plus Internet Explorer 7 and above.
- Has a simple one-column layout, and no main menu in the `header` section of the site so users can get to your content quickly.
- Features the lovely [Noticia Text web font](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Noticia+Text).
- By default, Accessible Zen will display the site owner’s [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) in the header. You can replace this by uploading a Custom Header Image in Appearance -> Header, or you can remove it completely by selecting Remove Header Image.
- Features all nine [post formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats).
- Shows menus only when you need them. Accessible Zen doesn’t display a menu as a default to keep it as simple as possible. Of course, if your site needs a menu you can easily set up a Custom Menu in Appearance -> Menus. The theme features two menus, which display in the `footer' section of the site.
- Tight integration with the [WordPress Theme Customizer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API), allowing site owners to edit the theme's appearance on the fly. They can show/hide the site description and display excerpts or full content on archive pages.
- Includes two page templates: an archives template, which features an archive of posts in different ways; a front page template, which allows site owners to feature content with unique styling. Plus, the page shows only one post by default, allowing users to focus on your latest and greatest content.
- Incorporates the font icon, [Genericons](http://genericons.com/) in a few spots throughout the theme.
- Treats the [WordPress except](http://codex.wordpress.org/Excerpt) and [Read More tag](http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_the_Read_More) with care, and displays the post title so excerpts output like this: `Continue reading Post Title`

## Documentation

Coming soon. Promise! I plan to include basic documentation in this `readme.md` file, and create a series of blog posts about the theme and the lessons I learned.
